# Monte Carlo Simulation

#### This research project's focus is to explore the workings of Monte Carlo Simulations.
#### Monte Carlo Simulation is a method that utilizes repeated random sampling to model and evaluate complex systems. 

Important theorems used in Monte Carlo Simulations are:
- Law of Large Numbers
- Central Limit Theorem
