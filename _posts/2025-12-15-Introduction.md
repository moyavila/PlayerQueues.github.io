# Monte Carlo Simulation

#### This research project's focus is to explore the workings of Monte Carlo Simulations.
#### Monte Carlo Simulation is a method that utilizes repeated random sampling to model and evaluate complex systems. 

An important theorem used in Monte Carlo Simulations is the Law of Large Numbers.

Law of Large Numbers is that as the number of observations increases, it reaches a point where the average sample relatively equals the mean. 
This is important for Monte Carlo Simulations because we simulate large amounts of random repeated trials, therefore with this theorem we have more control over our estimates and the outcome is more accurate.

## Queueing Systems
Utilizing the logic of Monte Carlo Simulations, we are able to replicate real-world systems such as Queueing Systems.
