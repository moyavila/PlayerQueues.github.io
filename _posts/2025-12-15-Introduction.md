# Monte Carlo Simulation

#### This research project's focus is to explore the workings of Monte Carlo Simulations.
#### Monte Carlo Simulation is a method that utilizes repeated random sampling to model and evaluate complex systems. 

Two important theorems used in Monte Carlo Simulations are Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem.

Law of Large Numbers is that as the number of observations/trials increases, it reaches a point where the average sample relatively equals the mean. 
This is important for Monte Carlo Simulations because we simulate large amounts of random repeated trials, therefore with this theorem we have more control over our estimates and the outcome is more accurate.
